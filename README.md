   git clone https://github.com/rohitp-18/expense-tracker-app.git
   cd expense-management-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

## Building APK for Android üì±

To build your app for Android and generate an APK file, follow these steps:

1. **Login to EAS**:
   - Run the following command to check the current user you're logged in as:
     ```bash
     eas whoami
     ```
   - If you‚Äôre not logged in yet, run the command:
     ```bash
     eas login
     ```

2. **Install EAS CLI** (if not installed):
   ```bash
   npm install --global eas-cli
   ```

3. **Initialize Your Project**:
   - If you're creating a new project using **Expo**, run the following command:
     ```bash
     eas init --id <your_id>
     ```

4. **Build for Android**:
   - Start the build for the Android platform using the command:
     ```bash
     eas build -p android
     ```

5. **APK or AAB File**:
   - If the build completes successfully, you will get an `.apk` file for Android. If not, you'll get an `.aab` file. In that case, follow the additional steps below to generate the APK.

6. **Using AAB to Generate APK** (if you get `.aab`):
   - Download **BundleTool** from the official GitHub releases page:
     [BundleTool Releases](https://github.com/google/bundletool/releases)
   - Download and extract the **`.aab`** and **`bundletool-all-1.18.0.jar`** files into the same folder.
   - Open a **command prompt** in that folder and run the following command to generate APKs from the `.aab` file:
     ```bash
     java -jar bundletool-all-1.18.0.jar build-apks --bundle=app.aab --output=expense.apks --mode=universal
     ```

   - Replace `app.aab` with the name of your `.aab` file, and replace `bundletool-all-1.18.0.jar` with the name of your **bundletool jar** file.
   - The output will generate an **`.apks`** file, which contains the APKs.

7. **Extract the APK**:
   - Compress the `.apks` file into a `.zip` archive and then extract it. You will find the generated APK file inside.

## Usage üìñ

1. Open the app on your device or emulator.
2. Use the interface to add, view, edit, and delete expenses.
3. Filter expenses to view specific categories or date ranges.
